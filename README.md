In this repository, I will be describing and protraying my sample interface, that the user may encounter based on a given sysnopsis.

To begin with the task was to create and populate a database using a certain dataset, this dataset included users, workplaces, univeristies, friends and messages which all linked to the user using a primary key. 
But before I could create and populate the database I had to create UML diagrams, such as Entity Relationship Diagrams, class diagrams, sequence and state diagrams, which were completed by me normalising the data into third normal form. 

The diagrams described above are found in my report. 

So for the sample interface. 

First of all was to create the connection between the interface and the database, this can be found in the file DBConnection in the file section above. 
Next I wanted to create a simple log in screen, to replicate what the user would have to go through to access their profile,  this can be seen below,
